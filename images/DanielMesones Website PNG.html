    </div>
    
    <P> I am pursuing a game development major. I started at CSUSB in Fall 2021 as a transfer student. I have gone through the ranks and only need less than 10 courses to finally graduate.  My expected graduation date is Spring 2025. My ultimate dream would be to work for the video game company 'Naughty Dog.' To achieve that goal I will start off as a quality assurance tester for games and work my way up to a game designer position.  </P>

        <p>  <center> How did I get here? </center> </p>
    </div>

    <p> I was originally attending University of Redlands back in 2018 pursuing a psychology's degree. I lived on campus for a couple of years. After some time I realized this was not my passion and took a year off of school. I decided to then pursue a game development degree at CSUSB. </p>

    <div class="section"
        <p>  <center>  What is the Goal?  </center> </p>
    </div>

    <p>My ultimate dream would be to work for the video game company 'Naughty Dog.' To achieve that goal I will start off as a quality assurance tester for games. My plan will be to start off at other video game companies to get experience at other places and see what the process is like to bring a video game to life. I will work my way through the ladder and, ideally, work at naughty dog for as long as possible.   </p>
